# Troika Framework Core

This package contains the core code behind the Troika framework, shared by the [Troika 3D](../troika-3d) and [Troika 2D](../troika-2d) implementation packages.

## Installation

You can get it directly from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/troika-core):

```sh
npm install troika-core
```

However, you'll probably just want to install the [Troika 3D](../troika-3d/README.me#installation) and/or [Troika 2D](../troika-2d/README.me#installation) packages instead, both of which will pull in `troika-core` as a dependency.
