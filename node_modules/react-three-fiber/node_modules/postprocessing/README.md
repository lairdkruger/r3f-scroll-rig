A post processing library that provides the means to implement image filter effects for [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

*[Demo](https://vanruesc.github.io/postprocessing/public/demo)&ensp;&middot;&ensp;[Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/postprocessing-25rts)&ensp;&middot;&ensp;[Documentation](https://vanruesc.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs)&ensp;&middot;&ensp;[Wiki](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing/wiki)*


## Installation

This library requires the peer dependency [three](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

```sh
npm install three postprocessing
```


## Usage

Please refer to the [usage example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/README.md) of three.js for information about how to setup the renderer, scene and camera.

```js
import { Clock, PerspectiveCamera, Scene, WebGLRenderer } from "three";
import { BloomEffect, EffectComposer, EffectPass, RenderPass } from "postprocessing";

const composer = new EffectComposer(new WebGLRenderer());
const camera = new PerspectiveCamera();
const scene = new Scene();
const clock = new Clock();

composer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera));
composer.addPass(new EffectPass(camera, new BloomEffect()));

(function render() {

	requestAnimationFrame(render);
	composer.render(clock.getDelta());

}());
```


## Output Encoding

Simply set `WebGLRenderer.outputEncoding` to the desired target color space and `postprocessing` will follow suit. Built-in passes automatically encode colors when they render to screen and internal render operations are always performed in linear color space. It's [recommended](https://blog.demofox.org/2018/03/10/dont-convert-srgb-u8-to-linear-u8/) to enable high precision frame buffers when using `sRGBEncoding`:

```js
import { HalfFloatType } from "three";

const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer, {
	frameBufferType: HalfFloatType
});
```


## Performance

This library provides an [EffectPass](https://vanruesc.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/class/src/passes/EffectPass.js~EffectPass.html) which automatically organizes and merges any given combination of effects. This minimizes the amount of render operations and makes it possible to combine many effects without the performance penalties of traditional pass chaining. Additionally, every effect can choose its own [blend function](https://vanruesc.github.io/postprocessing/public/docs/variable/index.html#static-variable-BlendFunction).

All fullscreen render operations also use a [single triangle](https://michaldrobot.com/2014/04/01/gcn-execution-patterns-in-full-screen-passes/) that fills the screen. Compared to using a quad, this approach harmonizes with modern GPU rasterization patterns and eliminates unnecessary fragment calculations along the screen diagonal. This is especially beneficial for GPGPU passes and effects that use complex fragment shaders.
